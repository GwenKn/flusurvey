  abstract        = {The clinical, public health and economic implications of antimicrobial resistance present a major threat to future healthcare. Antimicrobial use is a major driver of resistance, and antimicrobial stewardship programmes are increasingly being advocated as a means of improving the quality of prescribing. However, to increase their impact and assess their success, a better understanding of antimicrobial usage, both in primary and secondary care, and linkage with antimicrobial resistance data are required. In England, national summaries of primary care dispensing data are issued annually by the Health and Social Care Information Centre. However, there is currently no routine public reporting of antimicrobial usage in hospitals. In response to the threat posed by antimicrobial resistance, as highlighted in the Report of the Chief Medical Officer and on the request of the Department of Health, Public Health England has developed a new national programme, the English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilization and Resistance (ESPAUR). The programme will bring together the elements of antimicrobial utilization and resistance surveillance in both primary and secondary care settings, alongside the development of quality measures and methods to monitor unintended outcomes of antimicrobial stewardship and both public and professional behaviour interventions. This article reports on the background to the programme development, the current oversight group membership and the public reporting structure. },

  abstract        = {Influenza and Influenza-like-illness (ILI) represents a substantial public health problem, but it is difficult to measure the overall burden as many cases do not access health care. Community cohorts have the advantage of not requiring individuals to present at hospitals and surgeries and therefore can potentially monitor a wider variety of cases. This study reports on the incidence and risk factors for ILI in the UK as measured using Flusurvey, an internet-based open community cohort. Upon initial online registration participants were asked background characteristics, and every week were asked to complete a symptoms survey. We compared the representativeness of our sample to the overall population. We used two case definitions of ILI, which differed in whether fever/chills was essential. We calculated ILI incidence week by week throughout the season, and investigated risk factors associated with ever reporting ILI over the course of the season. Risk factor analysis was conducted using binomial regression. 5943 participants joined the survey, and 4532 completed the symptoms survey at least twice. Participants who filled in symptoms surveys at least twice filled in a median of nine symptoms surveys over the course of the study. 46.1% of participants reported at least one episode of ILI, and 6.0% of all reports were positive for ILI. Females had slightly higher incidence, and individuals over 65 had the lowest incidence. Incidence peaked just before Christmas and declined dramatically during school holidays. Multivariate regression showed that, for both definitions of ILI considered, being female, unvaccinated, having underlying health issues, having contact with children, being aged between 35 and 64, and being a smoker were associated with the highest risk of reporting an ILI. The use of public transport was not associated with an increased risk of ILI. Our results show that internet based surveillance can be used to measure ILI and understand risk factors. Vaccination is shown to be linked to a reduced risk of reporting ILI. Taking public transport does not increase the risk of reporting ILI. Flusurvey and other participatory surveillance techniques can be used to provide reliable information to policy makers in nearly real-time.},

  abstract     = {Routine influenza surveillance, based on laboratory confirmation of viral infection, often fails to estimate the true burden of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the community because those with ILI often manage their own symptoms without visiting a health professional. Internet-based surveillance can complement this traditional surveillance by measuring symptoms and health behavior of a population with minimal time delay. Flusurvey, the UK's largest crowd-sourced platform for surveillance of influenza, collects routine data on more than 6000 voluntary participants and offers real-time estimates of ILI circulation. However, one criticism of this method of surveillance is that it is only able to assess ILI, rather than virologically confirmed influenza. We designed a pilot study to see if it was feasible to ask individuals from the Flusurvey platform to perform a self-swabbing task and to assess whether they were able to collect samples with a suitable viral content to detect an influenza virus in the laboratory. Virological swabbing kits were sent to pilot study participants, who then monitored their ILI symptoms over the influenza season (2014-2015) through the Flusurvey platform. If they reported ILI, they were asked to undertake self-swabbing and return the swabs to a Public Health England laboratory for multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction testing. A total of 700 swab kits were distributed at the start of the study; from these, 66 participants met the definition for ILI and were asked to return samples. In all, 51 samples were received in the laboratory, 18 of which tested positive for a viral cause of ILI (35%). This demonstrated proof of concept that it is possible to apply self-swabbing for virological laboratory testing to an online cohort study. This pilot does not have significant numbers to validate whether Flusurvey surveillance accurately reflects influenza infection in the community, but highlights that the methodology is feasible. Self-swabbing could be expanded to larger online surveillance activities, such as during the initial stages of a pandemic, to understand community transmission or to better assess interseasonal activity.},

  abstract        = {Seasonal influenza epidemics place considerable strain on health services. Robust systems of surveillance are therefore required to ensure preparedness. Sentinel surveillance does not accurately capture the community burden of epidemics as it misses cases that do not present to health services. In this study, Flusurvey (an internet-based community surveillance tool) was used to examine how severity of disease influences health-seeking behaviour in the UK. Logistic regression with random effects was used to investigate the association between health-seeking and symptom severity, duration of illness and reduction in self-reported health-score over four flu seasons between 2011 and 2015. The majority of individuals did not seek care. In general, there was very strong evidence for an association between all severity indicators and visiting a health service (p < 0.0001). Being female (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.23-2.14, p = 0.0003) and a self-diagnosis of the flu (OR 3.39, 95% CI 2.38-4.83, p < 0.0001) were also associated with increased likelihood of visiting a health service. During the 2012-13 and 2014-15 flu seasons, there was a significantly larger proportion of individuals with more severe sets of symptoms and a longer duration of illness. Despite this, the proportion of individuals with particular sets of symptoms visiting a health service showed only very slight variation across years. Traditional surveillance systems capture only the more severe episodes of illness. However, in spite of variation in flu activity, the proportion of individuals visiting a health service remains relatively stable within specific sets of symptoms across years. These data could be used in combination with data on consultation rates to provide better estimates of community burden.},

A total of 39% of all influenza-attributable general practitioner consultations and 37% of all influenza-attributable hospital admissions occur in those aged under 15 years. Few studies have quantified the impact of influenza outbreaks on families. We assessed this impact during 2 influenza seasons. We used questionnaires to obtain data in primary schools that reported an outbreak of an influenza-like-illness (ILI). We sought data on the loss of productivity, costs borne by families and loss in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). ILIs were identified using the symptoms criteria from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the UK Flusurvey. For each child reporting ILI, mean school absence was 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]): 3.0-4.8) with mean work absence for caregivers reported as 3.7 days (95% CI: 2.7-4.8). The mean loss in HRQoL was 2.1 quality-adjusted life days (95% CI: 1.5-2.7). The estimated total pediatric burden of disease for reported school-based outbreaks during the 2 influenza seasons was 105.3 QALYs (95% CI: 77.7-139.0). This study shows the potential social and economic benefit of vaccination of children during mild influenza seasons.},

  abstract        = {This paper reviews the key research literature regarding men's health-related help seeking behaviour. There is a growing body of research in the United States to suggest that men are less likely than women to seek help from health professionals for problems as diverse as depression, substance abuse, physical disabilities and stressful life events. Previous research has revealed that the principle health related issue facing men in the UK is their reluctance to seek access to health services. The investigation of men's health-related help seeking behaviour has great potential for improving both men and women's lives and reducing national health costs through the development of responsive and effective interventions. A search of the literature was conducted using CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Library databases. Studies comparing men and women are inadequate in explaining the processes involved in men's help seeking behaviour. However, the growing body of gender-specific studies highlights a trend of delayed help seeking when they become ill. A prominent theme among white middle class men implicates "traditional masculine behaviour" as an explanation for delays in seeking help among men who experience illness. The reasons and processes behind this issue, however, have received limited attention. Principally, the role of masculine beliefs and the similarities and differences between men of differing background requires further attention, particularly given the health inequalities that exist between men of differing socio-economic status and ethnicity. Further research using heterogeneous samples is required in order to gain a greater understanding of the triggers and barriers associated with the decision making process of help seeking behaviour in men who experience illness.},

Records with a prescription for systemic antibiotics were extracted and linked to co-occurring diagnostic codes, which were used to attribute prescriptions to clinical conditions. We further assessed which antibiotic classes were prescribed and which conditions resulted in the greatest share of prescribing. The prescribing rate varied considerably among participating practices, with a median of 626 prescriptions/1000 patients (IQR 543-699). In total, 69% of antibiotic prescriptions (n = 3 156 507) could be linked to a body system and/or clinical condition. Of these prescriptions, 46% were linked to conditions of the respiratory tract, including ear, nose and throat (RT/ENT); leading conditions within this group were cough symptoms (22.7%), lower respiratory tract infection (RTI) (17.9%), sore throat (16.7%) and upper RTI (14.5%). After RT/ENT infections, infections of the urogenital tract (22.7% of prescriptions linked to a condition) and skin/wounds (16.4%) accounted for the greatest share of prescribing. Penicillins accounted for 50% of all prescriptions, followed by macrolides (13%), tetracyclines (12%) and trimethoprim (11%). The majority of antibiotic prescriptions in English primary care were for infections of the respiratory and urinary tracts. However, in almost one-third of all prescriptions no clinical justification was documented. Antibiotic prescribing rates varied substantially between practices, suggesting that there is potential to reduce prescribing in at least some practices.},

These gaps were more pronounced in adult women (99% more prescriptions than men; 69% more when excluding UTI) than in children (9%; 0%) or the elderly (67%; 38%). Among adults, women accounted for 64% of consultations (62% among patients with comorbidity), but were not substantially more likely than men to receive an antibiotic prescription when consulting with common conditions such as cough (RR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.02), sore throat (RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.01) and lower respiratory tract infection (RR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.01). Exceptions were skin conditions: women were less likely to be prescribed antibiotics when consulting with acne (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.69) or impetigo (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.88). The gender gap in antibiotic prescribing can largely be explained by consultation behaviour. Although in most cases adult men and women are equally likely to be prescribed an antibiotic when consulting primary care, it is unclear whether or not they are equally indicated for antibiotic therapy.},

Prescribing guidelines were consulted to define the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy for the conditions that resulted in antibiotic prescriptions between 2013 and 2015 in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) primary care database. The opinions of subject experts were then formally elicited to quantify ideal antibiotic prescribing proportions for 10 common conditions. Of the antibiotic prescriptions in THIN, 52.5% were for conditions that could be assessed using prescribing guidelines. Among these, the vast majority of prescriptions (91.4%) were for conditions where antibiotic appropriateness is conditional on patient-specific indicators. Experts estimated low ideal prescribing proportions in acute, non-comorbid presentations of many of these conditions, such as cough (10% of patients), rhinosinusitis (11%), bronchitis (13%) and sore throat (13%). Conversely, antibiotics were believed to be appropriate in 75% of non-pregnant women with non-recurrent urinary tract infection. In impetigo and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, experts clustered into distinct groups that believed in either high or low prescribing. In English primary care, most antibiotics are prescribed for conditions that only sometimes require antibiotic treatment, depending on patient-specific indicators. Experts estimated low ideal prescribing proportions in many of these conditions. Incomplete prescribing guidelines and disagreement about prescribing in some conditions highlight further research needs.},

Primary care data from 2013-15 recorded in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database were used. Potentially inappropriate prescribing events in the database were identified by: (i) comparing prescribing events against treatment guidelines; (ii) comparing actual proportions of consultations resulting in prescription for a set of conditions with the ideal proportions derived from expert opinion; and (iii) identifying high prescribers and their number of prescriptions above an age- and body-system-specific benchmark. Applying the most conservative assumptions, 8.8% of all systemic antibiotic prescriptions in English primary care were identified as inappropriate, and in the least conservative scenario 23.1% of prescriptions were inappropriate. All practices had non-zero reduction potentials, ranging from 6.4% to 43.5% in the middle scenario. The four conditions that contributed most to inappropriate prescribing were sore throat (23.0% of identified inappropriate prescriptions), cough (22.2%), sinusitis (7.6%) and acute otitis media (5.7%). One-third of all antibiotic prescriptions lacked an informative diagnostic code. This work demonstrates (i) the existence of substantial inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and (ii) poor diagnostic coding in English primary care. All practices (not just the high prescribers) should engage in efforts to improve antimicrobial stewardship. Better diagnostic coding, more precise prescribing guidelines and a deeper understanding of appropriate long-term uses of antibiotics would allow identification of further potential for reductions.},

All recorded consultations for common infectious conditions (cough, bronchitis, exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sore throat, rhinosinusitis, otitis media, lower respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza-like illness, urinary tract infection, impetigo, acne, gastroenteritis) for 2013-15 were extracted from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. The proportions of consultations resulting in an antibiotic prescription were established, concentrating on acute presentations in patients without relevant comorbidities. These actual prescribing proportions were then compared with previously established 'ideal' proportions by condition. For most conditions, substantially higher proportions of consultations resulted in an antibiotic prescription than was deemed appropriate according to expert opinion. An antibiotic was prescribed in 41% of all acute cough consultations when experts advocated 10%. For other conditions the proportions were: bronchitis (actual 82% versus ideal 13%); sore throat (actual 59% versus ideal 13%); rhinosinusitis (actual 88% versus ideal 11%); and acute otitis media in 2- to 18-year-olds (actual 92% versus ideal 17%).

We hypothesized that a subset of patients account for the majority of antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. We investigated the relationship between the total amount of antibiotics prescribed, individual-level antibiotic use and comorbidity. This was a cohort study using electronic health records from 1 948 390 adults registered with 385 primary care practices in the UK in 2011-13. We estimated the average number of antibiotic prescriptions per patient and the association between prescribing and comorbidity. We modelled the impact on total prescribing of reducing antibiotic use in those prescribed antibiotics most frequently. On average 30.1% (586 194/1 948 390) of patients were prescribed at least one antibiotic per year. Nine percent (174 602/1 948 390) of patients were prescribed 53% (2 091 496/3 922 732) of the total amount of antibiotics, each of whom received at least five antibiotic prescriptions over 3 years. The presence of any comorbidity increased the prescribing rate by 44% [adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.44, 95% CI 1.43-1.45]; rates of prescribing to women exceeded those in men by 62% (adjusted IRR 1.62, 95% CI 1.62-1.63). Half of antibiotics prescribed to adults in primary care were for <10% of patients. Efforts to tackle antimicrobial resistance should consider the impact of this on total prescribing.},

A dataset was constructed containing data on standardised antibiotic prescribing volumes, practice characteristics, patient morbidity, ethnicity, social deprivation, and Quality and Outcomes Framework achievement (2004-2005). Data were analysed using multiple regression modelling. There was a twofold difference in standardised antibiotic prescribing volumes between practices in the 10th and 90th centiles of the sample (0.48 versus 0.95 antibiotic prescriptions per antibiotic STAR-PU [Specific Therapeutic group Age-sex weightings-Related Prescribing Unit]). A regression model containing nine variables explained 17.2% of the variance in antibiotic prescribing. Practice location in the north of England was the strongest predictor of high antibiotic prescribing. Practices serving populations with greater morbidity and a higher proportion of white patients prescribed more antibiotics, as did practices with shorter appointments, non-training practices, and practices with higher proportions of GPs who were male, >45 years of age, and qualified outside the UK. Practice and practice population characteristics explained about one-sixth of the variation in antibiotic prescribing nationally. Consultation-level and qualitative studies are needed to help further explain these findings and improve our understanding of this variation.},

We assessed the ecological association between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance rates using Spearman's correlation coefficients. Prescription of antibiotics in primary care in Europe varied greatly; the highest rate was in France (32.2 DDD per 1000 inhabitants daily) and the lowest was in the Netherlands (10.0 DDD per 1000 inhabitants daily). We noted a shift from the old narrow-spectrum antibiotics to the new broad-spectrum antibiotics. We also recorded striking seasonal fluctuations with heightened winter peaks in countries with high yearly use of antibiotics. We showed higher rates of antibiotic resistance in high consuming countries, probably related to the higher consumption in southern and eastern Europe than in northern Europe. These data might provide a useful method for assessing public-health strategies that aim to reduce antibiotic use and resistance levels.},

Overuse is especially a problem for children, since they are more affected by acute (often virus-caused) infections. While the problem has been addressed internationally over the past several years, regional variations in prescriptions are striking. Therefore, the present study aims to analyze regional variations in antibiotic prescription on a district level in Germany and tries to identify reasons for those variations through adding possible influencing factors to the analysis on individual and district levels. We analyzed 1.2 million children insured in a German health insurance fund. Antibiotic prescriptions were quantified in 2010 and reasons for prescriptions were analyzed in multilevel regressions based on the district of residence, regional deprivation, and age and sex of the child. Thirty-six percent of all children aged 0-17 years received an antibiotic prescription in 2010. In the south, prevalences are generally lower, and also to the very north. The highest prevalences are found in the close-to-border districts in the west, as well as in a band throughout the middle of Germany, in rather low population density areas. Regional variation in the prevalence range from 19 to 53 % between districts. Regional deprivation can explain part of this variation. Including area deprivation measures helped identify an influence of especially regional income and occupational deprivation on antibiotic prescriptions for children. Regional analysis such as this can help identify specific regions and groups of persons to address information programs on the risks of preventable antibiotic consumption and alternative treatment methods.},

The study population consisted of children who visited the Child Health Care (CHC) centres in Malmö for their 8-month health checkup during 2003-2006 and whose parents answered a self-administered questionnaire (n = 7266 children). The questionnaire was distributed to parents of children registered with the CHC and invited for an 8-month checkup during the study period. The odds of using antibiotics increased as parental educational level decreased. Using high educational level as a reference group, low maternal educational level was associated with an increased antibiotic use for the child, odds ratio (OR) = 1.61 (95% CI: 1.34-1.93). Furthermore, children whose parents were born outside Sweden showed higher antibiotic use, OR = 1.43 (95% CI: 1.24-1.65), in comparison with children whose parents were born in Sweden. Exposure to environmental smoking, parental experience of economic stress, and a low level of emotional support increased the odds for antibiotic use. Boys had higher odds of use of antibiotics than girls, OR = 1.40 (95% CI: 1.25-1.57). Having a low birth weight, having an allergy and having siblings also increased the odds for early antibiotic use, while breastfeeding seemed to have a protective role. There were clear associations between parental factors such as sociodemographic, psychosocial and lifestyle factors and antibiotic use at this early stage of life. Several characteristics of the child also affected the use of antibiotics.},

The prescription rates vary markedly in different countries, counties and municipalities. The reasons for these variations in prescription rate are not obvious. To find possible explanations for different antibiotic prescription rates in children. Prospective population based study. All child health clinics in four municipalities in Sweden which, according to official statistics, had high antibiotic prescription rates, and all child health clinics in three municipalities which had low antibiotic prescription rates. During one month, parents recorded all infectious symptoms, physician consultations and antibiotic treatments, from 848 18-month-old children in a log book. The parents also answered a questionnaire about socioeconomic factors and concern about infectious diseases. Antibiotics were prescribed to 11.6% of the children in the high prescription area and 4.7% in the low prescription area during the study month (crude odds ratio [OR] = 2.67; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.45 to 4.93). After multiple logistic regression analyses taking account of socioeconomic factors, concern about infectious illness, number of symptom days and physician consultations, differences in antibiotic prescription rates remained (adjusted OR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.14 to 5.98). The variable that impacted most on antibiotic prescription rates, although it was not relevant to the geographical differences, was a high level of concern about infectious illness in the family. The differences in antibiotic prescription rates could not be explained by socioeconomic factors, concern about infectious illness, number of symptom days and physician consultations. The differences may be attributable to different prescription behaviour.},

This study was undertaken to determine child, household and physician factors predictive of nonadherence to evidence-based antibiotic prescribing in children. The prescription and health care records of 20 000 Manitoba children were assessed for 2 criteria of nonadherence to evidence-based antibiotic prescribing during the period from fiscal year 1996 (April 1996 to March 1997) to fiscal year 2000: receipt of an antibiotic for a viral respiratory tract infection (VRTI) and initial use of a second-line agent for acute otitis media, pharyngitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection or cellulitis. The likelihood of nonadherence to evidence-based prescribing, according to child demographic characteristics, physician factors (specialty and place of training) and household income, was determined from hierarchical linear modelling. Child visits were nested within physicians, and the most parsimonious model was selected at p < 0.05. During the study period, 45% of physician visits for VRTI resulted in an antibiotic prescription, and 20% of antibiotic prescriptions were for second-line antibiotics. Relative to general practitioners, the odds ratio for antibiotic prescription for a VRTI was 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.62) for pediatricians and 1.58 (95% CI 1.03-2.42) for other specialists. The likelihood that an antibiotic would be prescribed for a VRTI was 0.99 for each successive 10,000 Canadian dollars increase in household income. Pediatricians and other specialists were more likely than general practitioners to prescribe second-line antibiotics for initial therapy. Both criteria for nonadherence to evidence-based prescribing were 40% less likely among physicians trained in Canada or the United States than among physicians trained elsewhere. The links that we identified between nonadherence to evidence-based antibiotic prescribing in children and physician specialty and location of training suggest opportunities for intervention. The independent effect of household income indicates that parents also have an important role.},

Number and rate of patients making a first return with sore throat, pharyngitis, or tonsillitis. Early returns (within two weeks) and complications (otitis media, sinusitis, quinsy). Outcomes were documented in 675 subjects (94%). Mean follow up time was similar (antibiotic group 1.07 years, other two groups 1.03 years). More of those initially prescribed antibiotics initially returned to the surgery with sore throat (38% v 27%, adjusted hazard ratio for return 1.39%, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.89). Antibiotics prescribed for sore throat during the previous year had an additional effect (hazard ratio 1.69, 1.20 to 2.37). Longer duration of illness (> 5 days) was associated with increased return within six weeks (hazard ratio 2.90, 1.70 to 4.92). Prior attendance with upper respiratory conditions was also associated with increased reattendance. There was no difference between groups in early return (13/238 (5.5%) v 27/437 (6%)), or complications (2/236 (0.8%) v 3/434 (0.7%)). Complications and early return resulting from no or delayed prescribing of antibiotics for sore throat are rare. Both current and previous prescribing for sore throat increase reattendance. To avoid medicalising a self limiting illness doctors should avoid antibiotics or offer a delayed prescription for most patients with sore throat.},

To evaluate the changing workload of middle ear disease in general practice, and the impact on surgery reattendance of prescribing antibiotics at first attendance. A case-linked cohort analysis for antibiotic prescribing versus no prescribing at first consultation event. Two hundred and ninety-one practices spread throughout the UK recording for the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and incorporating individual patient data records for 2,265,574 patients. All middle ear disease coded events that can be classed within acute otitis media (AOM) or glue ear sub-categories (and excluding chronic suppurative otitis media) were selected for analysis when the first event was from 1991-2001. The effect of antibiotic prescription on the risk of reattendance using Cox proportional hazards regression was analysed. Total consultations for AOM have fallen markedly over this decade, and glue ear consultations have risen but by a much smaller extent (26,000 decrease versus 4000 increase in consultations per year), which makes relabelling an unlikely explanation of the fall in AOM consultations. In the 2-10 years age range, consultations for AOM fell from 105.3 to 34.7 per 1000 per year, with glue ear consultations unaltered (15.2 to 16.7 per 1000 per year). Antibiotic prescribing for AOM has stayed remarkably constant (80-84% of consultations), but antibiotic prescribing for glue ear has risen sharply (13 to 62%). Prescribing antibiotics increased the risk of reattendance for AOM (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 to 1.10) and has reduced the risk of reattendance for glue ear (HR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.88 to 0.96). Prescribing antibiotics for AOM probably increased reattendance, but the opposite effect has been noted for glue ear, which suggests a treatment effect of antibiotics in glue ear. Further research is needed to clarify whether this possible benefit is worth the known harms, and if so in which subgroups of children.},

Of 10 981 randomly selected adults from England, Scotland and Wales, 7120 (65%) completed the questionnaire. Although 79% of respondents were aware that 'antibiotic resistance is a problem in British hospitals', 38% of respondents did not know that antibiotics do not work against most coughs or colds and 43% did not know that 'antibiotics can kill the bacteria that normally live on the skin and in the gut'. Respondents with lower educational qualifications were less knowledgeable about antibiotics. In a multivariable analysis, better knowledge of antibiotics was not associated with being less likely to be prescribed any in the last year, but was independently associated with being more likely to finish a course of antibiotic as prescribed. Knowledge was also associated with being more likely to take antibiotics without being told to do so. In women, better knowledge was associated with being more likely to give an antibiotic to someone else that was not prescribed for them. We have shown that there is no simple relationship between increased knowledge and more prudent antibiotic use. Future national antibiotic campaigns should have a defined audience and aims in order to facilitate prudent antibiotic use by clinicians and public.},

Descriptive analyses were stratified by gender, age and type of antibiotic. Separate analyses were performed to measure the most common underlying indications leading to the prescription of an antibiotic. The average yearly period prevalence of antibiotic use varied from 15 (Netherlands) to 30 (Spain) users per 100 patients. A higher prevalence of antibiotic use by female patients, the very young (0-9 years) and old (80+ years), was observed in all databases. The lowest point prevalence was recorded in June and September and ranged from 0.51 (Netherlands) to 1.47 (UK) per 100 patients per day. Twelve percent (Netherlands) to forty-nine (Spain) percent of all users were diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection, and the most common type of antibiotic prescribed were penicillin. Using identical methodology in seven EU databases to assess antibiotic use allowed us to compare drug usage patterns across Europe. Our results contribute quantitatively to the true understanding of similarities and differences in the use of antibiotic agents in different EU countries.},

We used healthcare data of 28.8 million adults from six population-based ARITMO project databases to ascertain information on systemic antibiotic use in Denmark (2000-2008), the Netherlands (1999-2010), Italy (2000-2010), the UK (1996-2009), and Germany (2004-2008). We estimated overall, and age-group and sex specific antibiotic use as defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day. We computed annual age- and sex-standardized population prevalence of antibiotic use per 1000 persons-years (p-y) and the mean duration (in days) of antibiotic use. The overall antibiotic use varied from 8.7 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day in the UK to 18.1 DDD in Denmark, representing a 2.1-fold geographical variation. In all countries, prescribing was relatively high among individuals aged 15-19 years; lower in those aged 20-50 years; and then increased steadily reaching 41.8 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day in individuals ≥ 85 years in Denmark. After age- and sex-standardization, prevalence of antibiotic use varied threefold from 160.2/1000 p-y in the UK to 421.1/1000 p-y in Italy. The ratio of broad- to narrow-spectrum penicillin, cephalosporin, and macrolide use varied from 0.6 in Denmark to 120.2 in Italy. Women used more antibiotics than men did in all countries. Across countries, the mean duration of antibiotic use varied 1.3 to 21.1-fold for different antibiotics. Antibiotic use is high in women and the elderly. Prescribing patterns vary substantially across European countries, both according to overall consumption, user prevalence, duration, and narrow- versus broad-spectrum antibiotics.},

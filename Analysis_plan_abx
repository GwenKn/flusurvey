Analysis plan for antibiotic data

# Data:
5 seasons of data (2012-2017)
3598 reports of antibiotic prescription out of a possible 236,483 with entries on abx use (T/F)
Number of prescriptions per year low 2012 to similar 2013-2017. 1-3%

# What do we want to look at? 
- how antibiotic prescribing varies by
  - age         [lowest in 18-45 but not big differences]
  - gender      [higher rate in females, nearly double]
  - region      [higher rate in Channel Islands (but v few data) and Northern Ireland]
  - education? 
  - vaccinated? [with vaccine more likely to have antibiotics = ppl more likely to access health care? or elderly? (i.e. bigger
  risk factors so get more intervention) control for? ]
  - contact with children?  [on living with children, seems no affect, need to check 0 = no, 1 = yes? ] 
  - whether visited a gp or hospital 
      - How many with antibiotics got it from a visit?  15% don't have information on a medical visit (527 / 3598)
      
  - how ill. health score?
  - length of time ill 
 
 - how many of the above should we also control by age / season? if sufficient data? 
 - I need to check when antibiotic stewardship interventions UK wide came in - perhaps do some analysis before and after this?
 
 - can we determine what drives most antibiotic use? as in are there shared charateristics between those that have an antibiotic 
 prescription and those that don't? 
 
 - look at previous flusurvey patterns and UK "risk factors" for antibiotic use and pull these out of the data

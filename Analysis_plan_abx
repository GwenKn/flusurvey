Analysis plan for antibiotic data

# Data:
5 seasons of data (2012-2017)
3598 reports of antibiotic prescription out of a possible 236,483 with entries on abx use (T/F)
Number of prescriptions per year low 2012 to similar 2013-2017. 1-3%

# What do we want to look at? 
- how antibiotic prescribing varies by
  - age         [lowest in 18-45 but not big differences]
  - gender      [higher rate in females, nearly double]
  - region      [higher rate in Channel Islands (but v few data) and Northern Ireland]
  - education? / employment status? 
  - vaccinated? [with vaccine more likely to have antibiotics = ppl more likely to access health care? or elderly? (i.e. bigger
  risk factors so get more intervention) control for? ]
  - living with children [seems no affect, need to check 0 = no, 1 = yes? ] 
  - contact with lots of children?  


  - whether visited a gp or hospital 
      - How many with antibiotics got it from a visit?  15% don't have information on a medical visit (527 / 3598)
      
  - how ill. health score?
  - length of time ill 
  
 From Alma's paper (x don't include) :
  - x? pet
  - having pre-existing health conditions (asthma, diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, immuno-compromising conditions); 
  - allergies; 
  - smoking (any number of cigarettes); 
  - x? regular use of public transport

QN
 - how many of the above should we also control by age / season? if sufficient data? what about "episodes" (data = number of episodes where 
 antibiotics were given / check number of people) Decide based on sub-populations (CC suggestion)
   -  I need to check when antibiotic stewardship interventions UK wide came in - perhaps do some analysis before and after this?
 
 - can we determine what drives most antibiotic use? as in are there shared charateristics between those that have an antibiotic 
 prescription and those that don't? who is most likely to get antibiotics? multivariate regression 
 
 - can we say how much antibiotic use is "appropriate" and how much for ppl with 'flu?
    Don't go there - complicated word "appropriate"
 
 - look at previous flusurvey patterns and UK "risk factors" for antibiotic use and pull these out of the data
 
 TO DO 
 (01/08/17)
 x continue with plotting individual links but use "bt" instead of "dt" as this has an individual line for each episode of illness. 
 x some new ones to do (education / health score /ili etc and children / visits to healthcare to tidy up)
 x eventual figures would be "all data" as  scatterplot rather than mean and range
 - When done, use  flusurvey/analysis/contacts_model.r to do multivariate analysis. Use binomial(p) for overall antibiotic use y/n. Then 
 multivariate would be a logit model. Firstly try with no interacting parameters (b3 . lc. age) then add these in and compare AIC? 
 x write up as go. Check factors to include with Ceire's work. 
 - results: basic reporting of data (how many episodes, rate of prescriptions per season) then multivariate analysis
 (03/08/17)
 - check analysis again Peppa et al results - health score / education affects medical care seeking. 
 - check VISITS analysis
 - check item list of univariate to decide for multivariate
 
 (30/10/17)
 - just compare a small number of models (e.g. full multivariate, ones with age and gender, one with socioeconomic? (important univariate?))
- look at per person: what is the rate of antibiotic prescribing per person? does this change? much variation? 
- look at, if took antibiotic, what do you think is causing the symptoms? how many inappropraitely prescribe?
